// Task
// For given function type Fn, and any type A
// (any in this context means we don't restrict the type, and I don't have in mind any type ðŸ˜‰)
// create a generic type which will take Fn as the first argument, A as the second, and
// will produce function type G which will be the same as Fn but with appended argument A as a last one.
